This is my Introduction to Data Analysis course term project. 

In this project I created a Bitcoin Price Prediction Model utilizing past price action from 4 different Bitcoin datasets and 2 other datasets of other cryptocurrencies Ethereum and Chainlink

The project is made up of 3 parts. 
The first part is Exploratory Data Analysis. I started with checking the data and fixing the missing values. My main dataset had no missing values but I had to fix a few others. Then, I started with the basic visualizations of descriptive statistics and visualization of price trends based on time and volume.
In the second part, Statistical Analysis and Hypothesis Testing, I made statistical tests on selected features, tests on how one metric effects other metrics and I examined if the price movement was based on periodic changes (price movement on same month every year, first week each month etc).
And at part 3, Machine Learning is where I used Linear Regression, Decision Trees and Random Forest Regressor to make a simple recommendation system whether to buy or sell Bitcoin given last 30 days data. I used hyper parameter tuning to enhance the prediction.
